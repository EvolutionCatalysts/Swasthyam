When the Covid-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the WHO it led to global policies of distancing, quarantines, travel restrictions, and cancellations of large gatherings, schools, colleges, shutting down offices and enabling employees to work remotely to aid in decreasing viral spread. In general public, significant anxiety is largely focused on family members and loved ones potentially contracting Covid-19, and is exacerbated by social media, self-quarantine, and misinformation.
